# data_science_toolbox
This repository serves as a library of my Data Science Toolbox. I use it to document all techniques that I have learned throughout my Master in Analytics at the University of Chicago. I learned about these techniques in classes such as Statistical Analysis, Non-Linear Models, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Advanced Machine Learning and applied them in several projects that I have worked on with my fellow students.
