# Data Science Toolbox

This repository represents a library containing the Data Science tools that I am familiar with. I use it to document all techniques that I learn throughout my Master in Analytics at the University of Chicago. I learned about these techniques in classes such as Statistical Analysis, Non-Linear Models, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning and applied them in several projects that can be found on my profile as well. The repository is structured along the typical pipline of a data science project: 
1. Data Exploration: 01_data_exploration
2. Feature Engineering: 02_feature_engineering
3. Unsupervised Learning: 03_unsupervised_machine_learning
4. Model Development: 04_supervised_machine_learning, 05_deep_learning
5. Model Assessment: 06_model_assessment

I also added a section on relevant stats background (07_stats_background), optimization methods (08_optimization_methods), and the data used to run examples (09_data_description). Here are some examples of the techniques that I cover in this repository:
- Kernel Density Estimation
- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
- Principal Component Analysis
- Truncated SVD
- t-SNE
- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- Agglomerative Clustering
- Copulas
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forrest
- Gradient Boosting
- Graph Networks
- Apriori Algorithm
- Artificial Neural Networks
