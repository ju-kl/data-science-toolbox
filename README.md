# Data Science Toolbox

This repository represents a library with the Data Science tools that I am familiar with. I use it to document all techniques that I have learned throughout my Master in Analytics at the University of Chicago. I learned about these techniques in classes such as Statistical Analysis, Non-Linear Models, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning and applied them in several projects that can be found on my profile as well. The repository is structured along the typical pipline of a data science project: 
1. Data Exploration
2. Feature Engineering
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Supervised Learning
5. Model Assessment

I have also added a section on some stats background, misc methods and the data used to run examples of the techniques presented. Here are some examples of the techniques that I cover in this repository:
- Kernel Density Estimation
- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
- Principal Component Analysis
- Truncated SVD
- t-SNE
- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- Agglomerative Clustering
- Copulas
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Apriori Algorithm
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forrest
- Gradient Boosting
- Graph Networks
