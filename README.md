# Data Science Toolbox

This document serves as a library of the Data Science tools that I am familiar with. I use it to document all techniques that I have learned throughout my Master in Analytics at the University of Chicago. I learned about these techniques in classes such as Statistical Analysis, Non-Linear Models, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Advanced Machine Learning and applied them in several projects that I have worked on with my fellow students. The document is structured along the typical pipline of a data science project: 
1. Data Exploration
2. Feature Engineering
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Supervised Learning
5. Model Assessment

I have also added a section that describes that data that I have used throughout this document in order to run examples of each technique. Here are some examples of the techniques that I cover in this document:
- Kernel Density Estimation
- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
- Principal Component Analysis
- Truncated SVD
- t-SNE
- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- Agglomerative Clustering
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Apriori Algorithm
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forrest
- Gradient Boosting
- Graph Networks
